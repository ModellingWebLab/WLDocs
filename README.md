# The Cardiac Electrophysiology Web Lab

_The following document describes the **intended** features of the new web lab (2018-05-21)._

The Cardiac Electrophysiology Web Lab (WL) links models of cellular electrophysiology with protocols describing experimental procedures, and with experimental data obtained from the same procedures.
Users can simulate and view the outcome of applying any protocol to any (compatible) model, and can compare the results to stored experimental data files.
Using the same interface, users can compare data files to each other, or inspect the predictions of different models for the same experiment.
Moving beyond qualitative comparison, numerical error measures can be defined and then minimised by algorithmically tuning model parameters.
