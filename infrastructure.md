# Web Lab infrastructure

This document describes (or links to existing documentation of?) the infrastructure on which Web Labs (such as the Cardiac Electrophysiology one) run.

[Look here for issue tracking / project management](https://github.com/ModellingWebLab/project_issues/issues)

The best description of the full infrastructure is currently given as an [Ansible configuration](https://github.com/ModellingWebLab/deployment). There is an "ansible playbook" that can install the Web Lab for servers or locally, and load updates etc.

The plans for the final set-up are given in [this presentation Jonathan prepared for Harmony 2018](https://github.com/ModellingWebLab/WLDocs/blob/master/doc/WL2%20technical%20detail.pdf)
