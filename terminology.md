# Terminology

What do we mean when we blab web lab?

* **WL1** - The original Cardiac Electrophysiology Web Lab implementation. Doesn't have any data or fitting. Uses the Functional Curation syntax for experiments, and runs simulations using either Chaste or a CPython simulation back-end.
* **WL1** fitting prototype - An extension to WL1 created by Aidan, that uses a Python backend with CMAES and a custom adaptive MCMC routine to perform fitting on cardiac models.
* **WL1** electrochemistry prototype - An extension to WL1 to show the concept works beyond cardiac electrophysiology, and can be applied to e.g. electrochemistry problems
* **WL2** - A future implementation of the Cardiac Electrophysiology Web Lab, that includes experimental data and fitting capabilities
* **Web Lab** - The concept - and software for - a web-based tool that can combine model and experiment specifications to run simulations
* **Cardiac Electrophysiology Web Lab** - A Web Lab for the domain of cardiac electrophysiology (e.g. WL1 or WL2).
